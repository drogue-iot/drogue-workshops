== STM32 IOT01A example

This example application runs out of the box on the STM32 IOT01A development kits.  It uses the on board peripherals such as WiFi and the temperature sensor to send data to an HTTP endpoint such as Drogue Cloud.

NOTE: There are multiple variants of this kit, so the example must be compiled and run using feature flags.

=== Prerequisites

==== Hardware

* STM32 IOT01A development kit

==== Software

* To build the example, you need to have link:https://rustup.rs/[rustup].
* To flash the example on the device, you need `probe-run` installed (`cargo install probe-run`).
* A Drogue Cloud instance. See link:https://github.com/drogue-iot/drogue-cloud/[drogue-cloud] for how to run that, or use the link:https://sandbox.drogue.cloud/[sandbox] (requires TLS).


=== Configuring

Credentials for your local WiFi network will come from these entries in `~/.drogue/config.toml`:

....
wifi-ssid = "..."
wifi-password = "..."
....

HTTP authentication will come from these entries in `~/.drogue/config.toml`:

....
http-username = "..."
http-password = "..."
....

For Drogue Cloud, the username/password is stored in this form: `device_id@application`.

You can find an example config file in link:.drogue/config.toml[]

== Running

To use this example with your own Drogue Cloud instance, you need to edit the HOST and PORT constants in `src/main.rs`.

To run the firmware using a given chip:

....
DEFMT_LOG=info PROBE_RUN_CHIP=STM32L4S5VI cargo run --release --features b-l4s5i-iot01a --no-default-features
....

If you have the B-475E-IOT01A board, use the following parameters:

....
DEFMT_LOG=info PROBE_RUN_CHIP=STM32L475VG cargo run --release --features b-l475e-iot01a --no-default-features
....

Once flashed, the device will reset and attempt to join the WiFi network. If successful, it will print a message to the RTT log. You can then press the blue/user button on the board to send a test message from the device.

== Troubleshooting

If youâ€™re experiencing problems, try setting the `VID:PID` values to that of your probe (you can find that from lsusb once your board is powered).

....
<ENV> cargo run <ARGS> -- --probe <VID>:<PID>
....

Additionally, the B-L4S5I-IOT01A board can have issues with running probe multiple times, leading to errors like

```
Error: An error with the usage of the probe occured

Caused by:
    Operation timed out
```

If you experience that, the best way to restore the board is to reconnect it and use `st-flash` utility to write any binary to it, like

```
st-flash write ../target/thumbv7em-none-eabihf/release/wifi-websockets-workshop.d 0x8000000
```

After reconnecting the board again, you should be able to use `cargo run` again.

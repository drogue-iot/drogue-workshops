= Toolchain setup

In order to create a device firmware, you will need to set up an embedded toolchain for Rust.

== Install `rustup`

In order to install Rust and Rust components, you will need https://rustup.rs/[rustup]:

On Unix-like environment, the following command should work just fine:

[source]
----
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
----

There are other ways to install `rustup`. Check its homepage to learn more.

Also see:

* https://rustup.rs/[rustup homepage]

You'll also need to install `nightly` toolchain with by running

[source]
----
rustup toolchain install nightly`
----

== Install an embedded toolchain

By default, `rustup` will install a toolchain (compiler, â€¦) for your current host architecture and operating system.

When compiling a device firmware, we need to have a compiler for a different architecture (CPU). The examples used in this workshop contain a rust-toolchain file which will tell rustup to automatically download the toolchain required for your board.

== Additional tools

In addition to the actual toolchain, you will need tools to flash the firmware to your device, and to monitor what is going on.

There are a few tools for Rust which can help here. However, we will focus on the https://github.com/knurling-rs/probe-run[probe-run].

You can install `probe-run` be executing the following command:

[source]
----
cargo install probe-run
----

Make sure you properly set up probe, like for example set link:https://probe.rs/docs/getting-started/probe-setup/[udev rules] on Linux to allow users without root privileges access to the debug probes as well.

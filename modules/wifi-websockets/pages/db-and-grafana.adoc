= TimescaleDB and Grafana

Having an easy way to visualize your data using Websocket application is great getting started experience. The next logical step for most applications is to provide a storage for the data along with the way to create custom dashboards. For this purpose, using https://www.timescale.com/[TimescaleDB] time series database based on Postgres and https://grafana.com/[Grafana] is a popular choice. For this purpose we provided a ready to use Helm chart that you can deploy in any Kubernetes cluster and get your IoT telemetry application ready to use.

== Deploying

Let's deploy this example and configure it to store and visualize our device temperature data. For that we will need Kubernetes cluster and https://helm.sh/[Helm] available on our machine. In this case we will use https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/[Minikube], but any other will work just fine.

First, you need to start the Minikube

[source]
----
minikube start --addons ingress
----

Considering, we have our Drogue Cloud properly configured in the previous section, we need to create an _Access Token_ to connect to the sandbox.

[source]
--
$ drg admin tokens create

A new Access Token was created:

drg_HASH
Make sure you save it, as you will not be able to display it again.
--

Next, we'll install the Helm chart using your username and the previously generated token

[source]
----
$ helm repo add drogue-iot https://drogue-iot.github.io/drogue-cloud-helm-charts/
$ helm install --dependency-update --set global.domain=.$(minikube ip).nip.io \
--set drogueApplication.name=wifi-workshop \
--set source.drogue.user=dejanb \
--set source.drogue.token=drg_HASH \
drogue-cloud-examples
----

== Using

Now that we have our example up and running, we can take a look at our data in the dashboard.

First, you need to find out the ingress URL for your Grafana installation.

[source]
----
$ kubectl get ingress
NAME      CLASS    HOSTS                          ADDRESS         PORTS   AGE
grafana   <none>   grafana.192.168.64.86.nip.io   192.168.64.86   80      95s
----

Now, you can point your browser to https://GRAFANA_INGRESS_HOST (`grafana.192.168.64.86.nip.io` in this example) and login to the dashboard with `admin/admin123456`.

Your device temperature should show up in the `Example dashboard` similar to this

Feel free to play around with the dashboard and adjust it to your liking.

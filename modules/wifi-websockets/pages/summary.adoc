= Summary

That concludes the workshop! We've seen how you can use a WiFi-enabled microcontroller with a temperature sensor to send temperature data to Drogue Cloud, using the already available link:https://sandbox.drogue.cloud[sandbox].

After making sure the telemetry events arrived at the cloud, we ran a simple WebAssembly application to demonstrate how you can consume events from Drogue Cloud websockets, using the publicly available drogue-public-temperature application available on the sandbox.

We then saw how you tap into the event stream using Knative events and forward them to another data store used by Grafana to build a more powerful dashboard for long term monitoring of the event data.

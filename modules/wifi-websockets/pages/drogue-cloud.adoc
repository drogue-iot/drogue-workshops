= Drogue IoT Cloud setup

We will need to create a new application inside Drogue Cloud and register a device with it.

== Log in

Log into the sandbox using the `drg` tool:
[source]
----
drg login https://sandbox.drogue.cloud
----

== Create a new application

Simply create a new application using `drg`:

[source]
----
drg create app wifi-workshop
----

== Create device

Next, create a device:

[source]
----
drg create device --app wifi-workshop device1 --data '{"credentials":{"credentials":[{"pass":"mysecretpassword"}]}}'
----

If the device has been created successfully, proceed to the next step.

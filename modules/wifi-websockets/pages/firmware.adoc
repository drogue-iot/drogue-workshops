= Device firmware

The next step is to compile and flash the device's firmware.

NOTE: There are two variants of the IoT01A board. Both should work, but this guide will use the parameters for the L475E variant.

== Clone the Git repository

Clone the git repository with the example and check out the `0.5.0` tag:

[source]
----
git clone https://github.com/drogue-iot/drogue-device
git checkout 0.5.0
----

For the next steps, you will need to change into the sub-directory `examples/stm32l4/iot01a-wifi`:

[source]
----
cd examples/stm32l4/iot01a-wifi
----

IMPORTANT: If you don't use the iot01a board, you will need to adapt the firmware to match your device and
hardware configuration!

== Update the device configuration

For the device to access your WiFi network, you must add the SSID and PSK to the following files:

`config/wifi.ssid.txt`:: The WiFi network SSID
`config/wifi.password.txt`:: The WiFi network pre-shared key

For the device to access Drogue Cloud, it also needs the device credentials you created earlier:

`config/http.username.txt`:: The device username (I.e. `device1@wifi-workshop`)
`config/http.password.txt`:: The device password (I.e. `mysecretpassword`)

== Compile and flash

You can now compile and flash the firmware. Execute the following command:

IMPORTANT: You need to have the developer board attached to your computer.

[source]
----
DEFMT_LOG=info PROBE_RUN_CHIP=STM32L475VG cargo run --release --features b-l475e-iot01a,tls
----

== Checking the result

Once you flashed and started the program, `cargo run` will keep attached to the application running on the development
board. The output should look something like this:

[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----

Pay attention to the output in the event of an error.

The sensor data is automatically sent every 30 seconds. To send a message to Drogue Cloud manually, press the blue button on the board.

If the device is sending data successfully, we can confirm that the event is processed by Drogue Cloud by opening the link:https://sandbox.drogue.cloud[web console], navigate to the "Spy", and start it, using the Drogue application name you have assigned earlier.

On the web console, you should see the event, as received by Drogue Cloud.

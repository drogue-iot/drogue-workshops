= Device firmware

The next step is to compile and flash the device's firmware.

== Clone the Git repository

Clone the git repository with the example and check out the `0.3.0` tag:

[source]
----
git clone https://github.com/drogue-iot/drogue-device
git checkout 0.3.0
----

For the next steps, you will need to change into the sub-directory `examples/stm32l0xx/lora-discovery/`:

[source]
----
cd examples/stm32l0xx/lora-discovery/
----

IMPORTANT: If you don't use the "B-L072Z-LRWAN1" board, you will need to adapt the firmware to match your device and
hardware configuration!

== Update the device configuration

Locate the Device EUI, Application EUI, and Application Key, you created earlier. Add the keys into the following files:

`lora-discovery/config/app_eui.txt`:: The Application EUI
`lora-discovery/config/dev_eui.txt`:: The Device EUI
`lora-discovery/config/app_key.txt`:: The Application Key

== Compile and flash

You can now compile and flash the firmware. Execute the following command:

IMPORTANT: You need to have the developer board attached to your computer.

[source]
----
cargo run --release
----

It may happen that the operation fails, especially when you try to flash the board for the first time. If that's the case,
you can try running the following.

[source]
----
cargo build --release
probe-run target/thumbv6m-none-eabi/release/lora-discovery --connect-under-reset --chip STM32L072CZ
----

== Checking the result

Once you flashed and started the program, `cargo run` will keep attached to the application running on the development
board. The output should look something like this:

Pay attention to the line indicating that the LoRa network was successfully joined.

== Pressing buttons

You can already give it a try, and press the blue button on the board.

But before you do, open up the web console, navigate to the "Spy", and start it, using the Drogue application
name you have assigned earlier.

Now you can press the button! This will trigger the device to send some
information to the LoRa network. There is no one there to receive yet, it should still work.

On the web console, you should see the event, as received by Drogue Cloud.
